#Learning Plan: Porting the Theatre@First Website to WordPress (Draft v2)

##Introduction

Theatre@First (http://www.theatreatfirst.org/) is a registered non-profit community theater group based in Somerville, MA. It was founded by two very good friends of mine in 2004. Since August 2014, I have been volunteering as T@F’s webmaster, and am responsible for all updates to the site, which is currently based on old HTML, CSS, and some basic server-side includes. A long-standing goal has been for a webmaster to port the site to a WordPress installation so that other people in the group will be able to update the site without the webmaster becoming a bottleneck. This will also free up the webmaster’s time to take on a more strategic role with regard to the site. As part of the PHP and WordPress class last spring, I completed development of a homepage and a show page; this summer, I plan to continue development of the site.

##Total Project Deliverable Summary

For this project, I will deliver a new and improved WordPress-based version of the existing Theatre@First website, including:

* A custom WordPress theme
* Development of a revised visual design based on comps
* A database containing information from 2015 to act as proof of concept
* A set of usernames and passwords for roles who need access to the site

##Technology List

I plan to use the following technology as part of this project:

* Operating Systems: Mac OS X; possibly Windows 7 for some of the testing and design work
* Domain Name: taf2.leahbateman.com
* Content Management System: WordPress
* WordPress Plugins: Advanced Custom Fields; ACF Gallery; ACF Repeater; Akismet (if needed)
* Markup Languages: HTML 5, CSS 3
* Programming Languages: PHP, SQL, some canned JavaScript
* Text Editor: SublimeText 2 (to be purchased)
* Virtual Server: MAMP
* Database Client: Sequel Pro
* CSS Preprocessor (if appropriate): SASS
* Source Code Control System/Repository: Git/GitHub
* Browsers: A current set of the most common browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, and Internet Explorer
* Color Sampling Tools: Photoshop and perhaps Color Cop (PC only)
* Measuring and Cropping Tools: Photoshop, OS X screen capture capabilities, and perhaps FastStone Capture (PC only)

**Testing:** All files will be pushed to the listed domain name at least once a week. This will allow testing of the site’s functionality and of the WordPress database.

**WordPress Plugins:** I have used all of the listed plugins in the previous version of the website. Because this will be a live site at some point, some of the plugins may need to be purchased; I will do that as a donation to the group.

**Design Tools:** Our volunteer graphic designer will deliver the design as Photoshop files. Although I have used Photoshop to identify hex codes and measure pixels, I actually find it easier to perform these tasks using Color Cop and FastStone Capture, respectively.
